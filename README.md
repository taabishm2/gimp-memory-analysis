# Overview
With GIMP, we measure various performance parameters affected by memory management policies and compare different application-level memory allocators on these parameters. Finally, we suggest potential customizations that a custom application-level memory allocator could make. Our results demonstrate that the right allocator can improve GIMP execution times by up to 8% and reduce page faults by up to 20%.
